            <p>I love to hung out with friends. I am not an outing type though. I have soo much hobbies. I love watching Netflix. I love to sleep if sleeping is
                 considered as a hobby.
            
    I love calculations as well.</p> I have developed a whole new hobby all thanks to my bestie and I think I am gonna spend so much time to improve on it. 
    I love my new hobby I must say. I love to cat-walk as well.
